# VentureCapital_is_Biased-How-Women-Can-Beat-It
## Link: https://lnkd.in/dTRykpM
As of 2019, women-owned businesses are growing [2 times faster than all businesses nationwide](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190923005500/en/Woman-Owned-Businesses-Are-Growing-2X-Faster-On-Average-Than-All-Businesses-Nationwide), and yet, they only receive 2.8% of venture capital (VC) funding. 
Our goal for this project is to help female entrepreneurs from fundraising perspectives by understanding the VC fundraising capabilities and investigating gender disparity. <br> This leads us to our overarching question: what does it take for a women-owned business to receive VC funding? We explored this question in 2 directions: <br>
Prediction: We produced a model to predict which startups will proceed to further rounds of funding, which startups will get acquired, and which startups will file for an IPO by looking at different characteristics of the startups, such as the industry it is in, and the diversity of the founders/leaders.
<br> Bias Identification: We studied the relationship between the number of female partners that a VC has and the likelihood that the VC will invest in women-owned businesses. <br>
After exploring this question, we will provide recommendations to both women-owned startups as well as VCs to contribute to closing the gender gap in VC funding.
